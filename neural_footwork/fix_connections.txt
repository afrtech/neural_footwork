Connection Check Guide for Neural Footwork v2:

CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:

1. NOISE~ OBJECTS NOT ACCEPTING BANGS
   - Problem: Bangs were being sent directly to noise~ objects in hihat_v2.pd and snare_v2.pd
   - Fix: Added line~ or metro objects in between to properly convert control flow to signal flow
   - Details:
     * In hihat_v2.pd: Connected sequencer bangs to line~ objects, then connected noise~ to *~ objects correctly
     * In snare_v2.pd: Added metro 1 to feed the noise~ object continuously

2. DUPLICATE SIGNAL NAME WARNINGS
   - Problem: Multiple objects sending to same signal names (ch1-out~, ch2-out~, etc.)
   - Fix: Renamed send objects in neural_mixer_enhanced.pd to use channel-specific prefixes
   - Details:
     * ch1-out~ renamed to ambient-ch1-out~
     * ch2-out~ renamed to hihat-ch2-out~
     * ch3-out~ renamed to snare-ch3-out~
     * ch4-out~ renamed to tom-ch4-out~
     * Corresponding receive objects also updated

3. SIGNAL CONNECTION MISMATCHES
   - Problem: Audio signal outlets connected to non-signal inlets
   - Fix: Corrected connection directions in hihat_v2.pd
   - Details:
     * Connected noise~ outputs to *~ signal inlets
     * Fixed reversed connections where control signals were being sent to signal objects

REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. SIGNAL GENERATION:
   - Each channel (ambient_v2, hihat_v2, snare_v2, tom_v2) should output to both:
     a) throw~ ch1, ch2, etc. (for mixer routing)
     b) s~ neural1~, neural2~, etc. (for neural feedback)

2. MIXER ROUTING:
   - neural_mixer_enhanced should:
     a) Receive catch~ ch1-4 inputs
     b) Process through mute controls
     c) Process through brainmix for spatial stereo
     d) Send to gen_fx processor

3. EFFECTS ROUTING:
   - gen_fx should:
     a) Process the audio from mixer
     b) Send to export_rack for sampling
     c) Send to final output processing (clip/hip~/etc.)

4. OUTPUT CHAIN:
   - Check that export_rack outputs connect nowhere (they're just for saving files)
   - Ensure main outputs from gen_fx connect to *~ -> clip~ -> hip~ -> dac~

5. NEURAL FEEDBACK:
   - Verify r~ neural1~ etc. are connected to:
     a) inhibit signals (via threshold~ etc.)
     b) cortex processing in brain
     c) effects modulation

If everything is correctly connected, the final output should reflect all four channels
properly mixed and processed through the effects chain.
