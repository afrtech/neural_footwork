LOADBANG CONNECTION FIXES

Unconnected loadbang objects in Pure Data prevent proper initialization of your patch. Here's how to fix them for each file:

1. MAIN PATCH (neural_footwork_v2.pd):
   - Look for the loadbang at the top of the patch (likely object #1 or #3)
   - It should connect to the [delay 100] object 
   - The delay then connects to a message [; pd dsp 1]
   - CHECK: This initializes audio processing when the patch loads

2. NEURAL MIXER (neural_mixer_enhanced.pd):
   - Find the loadbang at coordinates around -50 10
   - It should connect to a message that initializes channel states
   - The message should look like [; pd dsp 1 ; $0-ch1-active 1...]
   - CHECK: This turns on all mixer channels when loading

3. INSTRUMENT PATCHES:
   - In ambient_v2.pd, hihat_v2.pd, snare_v2.pd, tom_v2.pd:
   - Each should have loadbangs that initialize parameters
   - Connect each loadbang to either:
      * A float box with default values
      * A message box with initialization values
   - These set default feedback, thresholds, etc.

4. NEURON ABSTRACTIONS:
   - Examine each loadbang in neuron.pd, neuron_inhib.pd, neuron_osc.pd
   - Connect them to default threshold and feedback values (typically 0.5, 0.3, 0.95)
   - These initialize the neural processing parameters

5. BRAIN MODULE (brain.pd):
   - Find the loadbang in the bottom section
   - Connect it to the [metro 50] object
   - This starts the neural activity monitoring

GENERAL APPROACH FOR EACH UNCONNECTED LOADBANG:
1. Ask: "What should initialize when this patch loads?"
2. Connect the loadbang to message boxes with those initial values
3. Each loadbang should trigger at least one action
4. Loadbangs with multiple outputs should use [t b b b] (trigger)

CRITICAL NOTE: If you're seeing unconnected loadbangs in abstractions, those are likely meant to be internal to those patches. The most important ones to check are in the main patch and mixer.
