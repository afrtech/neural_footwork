NEURAL FOOTWORK TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE - RESOLVED ISSUES

FIXED ERRORS (âœ“):

1. "warning: ch1-out~: multiply defined", "ch2-out~: multiply defined", etc.
   - CAUSE: Multiple objects trying to send to the same receive name
   - FIX APPLIED: Renamed send objects in neural_mixer.pd and neural_mixer_enhanced.pd:
     * neural_mixer.pd: Renamed to [s~ mixer-ch1-out~], [s~ mixer-ch2-out~], etc.
     * neural_mixer_enhanced.pd: Renamed to [s~ ambient-ch1-out~], [s~ hihat-ch2-out~], etc.
     * Updated corresponding receive objects to match

2. "audio signal outlet connected to nonsignal inlet (ignored)"
   - CAUSE: Trying to connect an audio signal (ending with ~) to a control inlet
   - FIX APPLIED: In hihat_v2.pd:
     * Fixed connection direction between noise~ and *~ objects
     * Connected noise~ outputs to signal inlets of *~ objects
     * Added proper line~ objects as envelopes

3. "noise~: no method for 'bang'"
   - CAUSE: Bangs being sent directly to [noise~] objects which don't accept bangs
   - FIX APPLIED:
     * hihat_v2.pd: Connected triggers to line~ objects, then to *~ objects, with noise~ connecting to signal inlets
     * snare_v2.pd: Added [metro 1] to feed the noise~ object continuously
     * tom_v2.pd: Added trigger objects to properly handle note generation

STILL NEEDED FOR AUDIO ISSUES:

1. "error opening audio: Internal PortAudio error"
   - CAUSE: Audio device configuration issue
   - FIX: In Pure Data, go to Media > Audio Settings:
     * Try a different audio driver (ASIO, CoreAudio, DirectSound)
     * Increase buffer size to 256 or 512
     * Set sample rate to match your system (usually 44100 or 48000)
     * Try a different output device if available

PATCH LOADING GUIDE:

1. First open neural_footwork_v2.pd (main patch)
2. Check Media > Audio Settings to ensure your audio device is configured correctly
3. If you see "compute audio" toggle in main patch, click it to enable DSP
4. For MIDI control, connect your Digitakt or other MIDI controller and check Media > MIDI Settings

If you encounter any other issues, consult the README.txt for full system instructions.

QUICK FIX STEPS:

1. AUDIO SETUP:
   - Open Pure Data
   - Go to Media > Audio Settings
   - Choose a different driver or increase buffer size
   - Click "Apply" and "OK"

2. DUPLICATE SIGNAL ERROR:
   - Open neural_footwork_v2.pd
   - Look for multiple [s~ ch2-out~] and [s~ ch3-out~] objects
   - Rename duplicates to [s~ ch2-out-alt~] etc.
   - Update any corresponding [r~ ch2-out~] to match

3. NOISE~ BANG ERRORS:
   - Open hihat_v2.pd and snare_v2.pd
   - Find where bangs connect directly to noise~ objects
   - Add a [t b] in between that connects to [metro 1]
   - Connect the metro to noise~

If these steps don't resolve the issues, try running the "v1" version from the original neural_footwork.pd file which might have a simpler configuration with fewer potential conflicts.

NOTE: The noise~ error happens because the drum generators are trying to trigger noise generators with bangs, but noise~ only accepts signal inputs.
