# neural_footwork
Neural network-based generative music system built in Pure Data
 ## Overview

  Neural Footwork is a sophisticated audio generation system that uses interconnected neural oscillators, DNA-based sequencers, and chaotic modulators to create emergent,
  evolving sound patterns. The system features 4 channels with cross-modulation capabilities and neural inhibition, creating complex rhythmic relationships.

  Key components:
  - Neural network brain with adaptive synaptic connections and plasticity
  - DNA sequencer with genetic mutation for evolving rhythms
  - Fractal oscillators using Mandelbrot/Julia set mathematics
  - Cross-channel inhibition creating emergent rhythm patterns
  - Neurally-controlled effects processing

  ## Features

  - **Neural Sound Generation**: Four interconnected channels with neural feedback paths
  - **Generative Sequencing**: DNA-inspired sequencers that evolve over time
  - **Channel Architecture**:
    - Ambient: Textural generator with Markov chain and granular processing
    - Hihat: Neural-controlled noise synthesis with spectral filtering
    - Snare: Chaotic oscillator with DNA rhythm sequencer
    - Tom: Pitch-sequenced percussion with tonal control
  - **Neural Mixer**: Cross-inhibition and adaptive mixing based on channel activity
  - **Neural Effects**: Delay, reverb, and bit manipulation controlled by neural activity
  - **MIDI Integration**: Control interface for Digitakt or other MIDI controllers
  - **Sample Export**: Record generated patterns for sampling into hardware

  ## Requirements

  - Pure Data (Pd) vanilla v0.51 or higher
  - No external libraries required - runs on stock Pd
  - Audio interface with stereo output
  - Optional: MIDI controller (optimized for Elektron Digitakt)

  ## Usage

  1. Open `neural_footwork_v2.pd` in Pure Data
  2. Enable DSP (Media > Audio Settings)
  3. Adjust parameters:
     - Neural feedback amount
     - DNA mutation rate
     - Chaos modulators
     - Channel thresholds
  4. Use MIDI controller for performance control:
     - Mute/unmute channels
     - Control neural weight randomization
     - Adjust feedback amounts
     - Freeze buffers for stutter effects

  ## Technical Details

  This system combines several approaches from neural networks, genetic algorithms, and chaos theory:
  - Static-weight neurons with nonlinear response
  - Inhibitory connections for rhythm emergence
  - Plasticity for evolving connections
  - DNA-based pattern generation with mutation properties
  - Chaotic oscillation using logistic map equations
